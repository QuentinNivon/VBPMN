Nature:		The TRAIAN compiler included in the CADP release has been
		upgraded from version 3.11 to 3.12. Among the 51 changes
		brought by TRAIAN 3.12 and listed on the web page
		   http://vasy.inria.fr/traian/traian_3_12.html
		one third of them directly concerns the users of CADP, namely:
		   items 556, 570, 571, 572, 573, 577, 579, 580, 581, 582,
		   583, 584, 585, 593, 594, and 596.

		Among them, five changes are not backward compatible, possibly
		requiring manual changes in existing LNT programs to keep
		them accepted by the CADP tools:

		- item 582: renaming of NAT constructor "ZERO" to "0".
		- item 584: insertion of "with get" to use field projections.
		- item 585: insertion of "with set" to use field updates.
		- item 593: insertion of "with ==", "with !=", "with <", etc.
		- item 596: insertion of "with string".

		Consequently, the demos 11, 23, 26, 29, 32, and 38 have been
		updated by inserting a few clauses "with =", "with !=", or
		"with <>" where appropriate.

		Also, the script "$CADP/com/traian_delete" (see item #2915
		above) has been removed, since TRAIAN 3.12 now uses the CADP
		script "$CADP/src/com/cadp_delete".
