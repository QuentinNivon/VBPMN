The tests located in this directory are separated into two parts:

1) The first part consists in the files named "Test<n>".
   These files correspond to the tests used to verify that the modifications applied to the LNT language have been
   handled correctly, i.e., that the translation from BPMN to LNT still works on the new version of CADP.

2) The second part consists in the files named "TestBehaviour<n>".
   These files correspond to the tests used to verify that the modifications applied to the VBPMN code generator
   still meet the expected behaviour of the translated BPMN processes.
   For now, only the main constructs of BPMN are handled by these tests, i.e., inclusive gateways (balanced or not),
   exclusive gateways (balanced or not), parallel gateways (balanced or not), and loops.
