The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3043, #3044.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3043: DONE-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3043
Date:		Mon Sep 23 10:32:33 CEST 2024
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, com/upc,
		doc/*/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.*

Nature:		For the "set" and "sorted list" types, the former versions of
		LNT2LOTOS supported a predefined function "diff" that computed
		the asymmetric difference of sets or sorted lists.

		From now on, LNT2LOTOS has been aligned on TRAIAN: it supports
		two predefined functions "diff" and "minus" that compute,
		respectively, the symmetric and asymmetric difference:
		   diff (S1, S2) = { x | (x in S1) xor (x in S2) }
		   minus (S1, S2) = { x | (x in S1) and not (x in S2) }

		Clearly, this change is not upward compatible, as the "diff"
		function now has a different semantics than in former versions
		of LNT2LOTOS. For instance, diff ({}, {1, 2}) returned {} and
		now returns {1, 2}.

		To ease the migration, the UPC shell script has been extended
		with a new key 2024-LNT-MINUS. Running UPC with this key
		should be done cautiously: it should only be done on LNT
		programs designed for LNT2LOTOS; moreover, UPC will propose
		to replace all occurrences of "diff" (in lower or upper case),
		including for user-defined diff functions: careful attention
		and manual updates are necessary.

-------------------#3044: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3044
Date:		Sun Sep 29 10:24:14 CEST 2024
Authors:	Hubert Garavel, Frederic Lang, and Wendelin Serwe (INRIA/
		CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		The TRAIAN compiler included in the CADP release has been
		upgraded from version 3.15 beta 5 to 3.15. Among the many
		changes brought by this new version, listed on the web page
		   http://vasy.inria.fr/traian/traian_3_15.html
		and not already documented above, 14 directly concerns the
		users of CADP and LNT2LOTOS, i.e.:
		 - better messages for write-write and read-write conflicts;
		 - bug fix for insufficient detection of write-write conflicts;
		 - more concise error messages when a function, process, or
		   event is invoked with incorrect/mistyped parameters;
		 - warnings for superfluous "access" constructs;
		 - cleaner semantics and analysis of "ensure" clauses.
