Nature:	    Following a change introduced in TRAIAN 3.13, LNT has been
            enhanced with an alternative notation for the "select"
            construct. From now on:

               select
                  B1
               []
                  ...
               []
                  Bn
               end select

            may also be written, equivalently:

               alt
                  B1
               []
                  ...
               []
                  Bn
               end alt

            The reasons for this evolution are threefold:

            - The keyword "alt" has the same length as "par", thus
              enforcing a nice symmetry, whereas "select" was sometimes
              felt too long and verbose.

            - Introducing the keyword "alt", which was present in the
              Occam language, is our tribute to Tony Hoare (see "The
              transputer and occam: a personal story", Concurrency:
              Practice & Experience, August 1991).

            - In the code and documentation of LNT2LOTOS, the word
              "select" was also used in other contexts: field selector,
              array selection, etc. Choosing a different name ("alt") for
              nondeterminism was therefore suitable.

            Notice that "alt" was already a reserved keyword of LNT since
            October 2020 (see above item #2633).

            From now on, "select" is deprecated. The use of "alt" should
            be preferred when writing new LNT programs. The evolution is
            scheduled in three steps:

            1. For one year, it will be possible to use either "select"
               or "alt". However, mixing both in the same LNT program is
               forbidden (leading to a fatal error).

            2. In the next year, the use of "select" will trigger a
               non-fatal warning.

            3. After two years, the use of "select" will trigger a
               fatal error.

            Users are thus advised to update their LNT programs. This can
            be done automatically by typing the following command:
               upc 2024-LOTNT-SELECT <directory>
                    which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
                    <directory>, look for ".lnt" files, and replace "select" by
            "alt" automatically.

            The LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual, the LNT_MERGE tool, many
            CADP demos, and the editor style files have been updated
            accordingly.

            Also, three obsolete symbolic links have been removed from
            the "ext" directory:
               ext/a2ps/lotosnt.ssh -> lnt.ssh
               ext/emacs/lotosnt-mode.el -> lnt-mode.el
               ext/jedit/lotosnt.xml -> lnt.xml

Nature: 	Following another change introduced in TRAIAN 3.13, a new
            static semantics for exceptions has been implemented in
            LNT2LOTOS.

            1. A new channel EXIT (similar to NONE, yet different) has
               been added to "lotosnt_predefined.lnt".

            2. The channel of the UNEXPECTED event is no longer NONE,
               but EXIT.

            3. From now on, the event parameters of LNT processes and
               functions, if they correspond to exceptions, should no
               longer be declared with channel NONE and the "raise"
               keyword (this keyword was already optional and deprecated
               for functions). Instead, they must be declared with
               channel EXIT.

            4. In the predefined library and scheme files of TRAIAN
               (namely, "lotosnt_predefined.lnt", "scheme_list.lnt",
               "scheme_sorted_list.lnt", and "scheme_set.lnt"), NONE
               has been replaced by EXIT in the definition of event
               parameters of standard functions.

            Users are thus advised to update their LNT programs. This can
            be done automatically by typing the following command:
               upc 2024-LOTNT-EXIT <directory>
                    which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
                    <directory>, look for ".lnt" files, and automatically update
            function and process definitions:

            - For instance, the following function definition:
                  function F [E : none] ... is ...
              will be replaced by:
                  function F [E : exit] ... is ...

            - For instance, the following process definition:
                  process P [E1: none, raise E2: none, E3: any] ... is ...
              will be replaced by:
                  process P [E1: none, E2: exit, E3: any] ... is ...

              Notice that "upc" only works if the "raise" keyword and
              the "none" channel are on the same line. Thus, some process
              definitions declaring exceptions must be updated manually;
              fortunately, such definitions are less frequent than
              functions raising exceptions.

            The static semantics of LNT has been modified as follows:

            - From now on, LNT.OPEN no longer filters the warnings:
                "raise" before event declaration is deprecated and
                should be removed (2 occurrences found)
              emitted by when TRAIAN when function or process definitions
              contain "raise" keywords.

            - TRAIAN now checks that all event parameters of functions
              have the channel EXIT.

            - TRAIAN now checks that, in any "raise E" instruction or
              behaviour, the event E has channel EXIT.

            - TRAIAN now checks that, in any "E(...)" behaviour, the
              event E does not have channel EXIT.

            - TRAIAN now checks that, in any "hide E ..." behaviour,
              the event E does not have channel EXIT.

            Part of these checks may also be done by LNT2LOTOS.

            The LOTOS and C code generated by TRAIAN has been modified,
            with occurrences of "NONE" replaced by "EXIT" if appropriate.

            The editor style files (in directory "$LNTDIR/ext") have been
            updated to recognize EXIT as a predefined channel, in the
            same way as NONE.
