Nature:		The LNT syntax for "in out" parameters of functions and
		processes has been simplified. Until now, these parameters
		were noted "!?X". From now on, they are noted "X?" (notice
		the query character occurs after the identifier).

		The following table recalls the evolution of the LNT syntax
		since the origin of LNT2LOTOS (2005), after the revision
		of 2022 (see item #2826 above), and at present (2025).

		   ------------------------------------------------------
		                        Ada     LNT       LNT       LNT
                                               (2005)    (2022)    (2025)
                   ------------------------------------------------------
		   input offer           -       !X        X         X
		   output offer          -       ?X        ?X        ?X
		   ------------------------------------------------------
		   "in" parameter        X       X         X         X
		   "out" parameter       X       ?X        ?X        ?X
		   "in out" parameter    X       !?X       !?X       X?
                   ------------------------------------------------------

		Consequently, the "!" character is now reserved for LNT
		pragmas. The former syntax "!?X" is still accepted for some
		tile, but now deprecated and triggers the following warning:

		   "!?X" for in-out parameters is deprecated and should be
		   replaced by "X?" (79 occurrences)

		Users are thus advised to update their LNT programs. This can
		be done automatically by typing the following command:
		   upc 2025-LNT-EXCLAIM-QUERY <directory>
		which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
		<directory>, look for ".lnt" files, and replace "!?X" by "X?"
		automatically.

		The LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual was updated accordingly. Also,
		a few typos reported by Amandine Heuls have been corrected.
