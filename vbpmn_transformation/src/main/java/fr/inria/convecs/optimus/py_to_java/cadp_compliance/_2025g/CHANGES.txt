The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3168, #3171.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3168: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3168
Date:		Wed Jul  9 17:41:19 CEST 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian, doc/pdf/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf,
		lib/LNT_V1.lib, lib/lnt_predefined.lnt,
		incl/LNT_V1.h, incl/lnt_predefined.h

Nature:		The library of predefined functions for the LNT language has
		been enriched with eight nullary functions:

		   FIRST : -> BOOL
		   LAST : -> BOOL
		   FIRST : -> NAT
		   LAST : -> NAT
		   FIRST : -> INT
		   LAST : -> INT
		   FIRST : -> CHAR
		   LAST : -> CHAR

		This change completes a former change undertaken in December
		2023 (see item #2948 above). The "LNT_V1" library of LNT2LOTOS,
		the "lnt_predefined" library of TRAIAN, TRAIAN itself, and
		the LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual have been updated accordingly.

		In a few cases, this change is not backward compatible. For
		instance, if E is an event declared with channel "any" and
		if FIRST denoted a nullary function of some user-defined
		type T, then the following behaviour:
		   E (FIRST)
		is no longer accepted, since FIRST is now overloaded, and
		should be replaced with:
		   E (FIRST of T)

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3171
Date:		Fri Jul 11 11:58:48 CEST 2025
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Author:		Wendelin Serwe (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/tgv.a, man/*/tgv.*, src/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.tcl,
		demos/demo_02/demo.svl, demos/demo_09/demo.svl

Nature:		The "-csg" option of TGV (an acronym of "Complete Sub-Graph",
		meant to generate the Complete Test Graph) has been renamed
		to "-all" in order to simplify TGV for end-users. The former
		option name "-csg" is now deprecated, but retained for
		backward compatibility.

		The TGV manual page, the EUCALYPTUS user interface, and demos
		02 and 09 have been updated accordingly.
