IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3066
Date:		Thu Nov 21 17:46:36 CET 2024
Authors:	Hubert Garavel, Frederic Lang, and Wendelin Serwe (INRIA/
		CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian, man/*/traian.*

Nature:		The TRAIAN compiler included in the CADP release has been
		upgraded from version 3.16 beta-5 to version 3.16 beta-7.
		This new version brings the following changes:

		a) TRAIAN now issues a warning (instead of an error) when the
		   pragma "!int_check N" occurs multiple times with the same
		   value of N.

		b) TRAIAN now checks that each module M is self-contained
		   (i.e., only uses types, channels, functions, and processes)
		   declared in M or modules transitively imported by M. This
		   ensures a DAG-like structure of module dependencies.

		   Precisely, TRAIAN issues new warnings when a module M uses
		   some type, channel, function, or process defined in another
		   module M' that is not imported by M:

		      type T is declared in non-imported module M'
		      channel C is declared in non-imported module M'
		      function F is declared in non-imported module M'
		      process P is declared in non-imported module M'

		   This message is displayed only once per module, even if
		   the type, channel, etc. is used multiple times.

		   LNT files included using TRAIAN's "library ... end library"
		   directives are not considered as modules, and thus not yet
		   concerned by these checks.

		More new features of TRAIAN are presented below (see items
		#3072 and #3075).
