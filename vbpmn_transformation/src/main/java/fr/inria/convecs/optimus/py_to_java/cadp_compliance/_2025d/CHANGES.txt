The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3115, #3117, #3119, and #3124.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3115: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3115
Date:		Mon Mar 17 18:55:21 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, com/lnt.open,
		doc/*/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf,
		demos/demo_10/demo.svl, demos/demo_12/Makefile,
		man/*/lnt2lotos.*, man/*/lnt.open.*,
		src/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.tcl, src/svl/standard

Nature:		Following the introduction of a "-main" option in TRAIAN
		(see item #3096 above), LNT2LOTOS has been aligned with TRAIAN
		by renaming its "-root" option to "-main". The former "-root"
		option of LNT2LOTOS has been kept temporarily, but it is now
		deprecated and will be removed in the future.

		Similarly, the "-root" option of the LNT.OPEN script has
		been renamed to "-main". Again, the former "-root" option of
		LNT2LOTOS has been kept, but is deprecated, and a warning is
		now displayed when "-root" is used.

		The LNT2LOTOS and LNT.OPEN manual pages have been updated
		accordingly. The LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual has also been
		modified, the notion of "root process" being replaced by "main
		process" (which makes a clearer difference with the concept
		of "root module"). SVL and the EUCALYPTUS graphical user-
		interface have been updated too.

-------------------#3117: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3117
Date:		Wed Mar 19 11:22:35 CET 2025
Authors:	Hubert Garavel and Frederic Lang(INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/caesar, com/lotos.open, com/lnt.open,
		man/*/caesar.*, man/*/lotos.*,
		src/eucalyptus/eucalyptus.tcl, src/svl/standard

Nature:		By symmetry with LNT2LOTOS (see item #3115 above), the
		"-root" option of CAESAR has been renamed to "-main" (the
		former "-root" option no longer exists in CAESAR). The
		LOTOS.OPEN and LNT.OPEN scripts, the CAESAR manual page,
		the EUCALYPTUS graphical user-interface, and SVL have been
		updated accordingly.

-------------------#3119: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3119
Date:		Fri Mar 21 17:51:44 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, bin.*/traian;
		doc/*/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf

Nature:		The LNT language was enriched with a "!virtual" pragma for
		(non-constructor) functions, which is similar to the "!virtual"
		pragma for processes (see item #3075 above).

		TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS have been extended to accept and take
		into account this pragma. Doing so, many error and warning
		messages have been introduced or enhanced, e.g.:

		- error: virtual function F is already declared at...
		- error: virtual function F has different parameter names at...
		- error: virtual function F has different parameter types at...
		- error: virtual declaration without actual function F
		- error: forbidden constructor for virtual function F at...
		- warning: useless virtual declaration for actual function F
		  present at...
		- warning: "in var" parameter X of virtual function F should
		  be an "in" parameter
		etc.

		The LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual has been updated to document
		"!virtual" pragmas for functions.

-------------------#3124: NOTHING TO DO????-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3124
Date:		Wed Apr  2 19:15:41 CEST 2025
Report:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Authors:	Frederic Lang, Wendelin Serwe, and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/
		CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian

Nature:		Various warning and error messages emitted by TRAIAN have been
		enhanced as follows:

		1) When an imported module or library cannot be found, TRAIAN
		   now displays a more detailed message, e.g.:

		     error: module file "F.lnt" is readable neither in "."
		        nor "/opt/CADP/lib"
		     error: library file "F.lnt" is readable neither in "."
		        nor "/opt/CADP/lib"

		   whereas, formerly, it would only report that "F.lnt" was
		   not readable.

		2) When a "with" function is defined with pragmas "!external"
		   or "!virtual", e.g.:

		      type T is
		         set of NAT
		         with == !external !implementedby "EQ"
		      end type

		   TRAIAN now emits a specific error message:

		      forbidden pragma !external for "with" function ==

		   which is clearer than the formerly emitted message:

		      non-empty, non-null definition for external function ==

		3) TRAIAN now emits a warning when the deprecated keyword
		   "select" is used (see item #2982 above):

		      "select" is deprecated and should be replaced by "alt"
		      (12 occurrences found)

		   The replacement of "select" by "alt" can be performed
		   automatically by calling UPC with its "2024-LNT-SELECT" key.
