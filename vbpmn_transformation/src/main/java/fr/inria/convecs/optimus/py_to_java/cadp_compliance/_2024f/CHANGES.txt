-------------------#3007: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3007
Date:		Fri Jun  7 12:06:58 CEST 2024
Author:		Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/bcg_steady, bin.*/bcg_transient,
		    man/*/bcg_steady.*, man/*/bcg_transient.*,
		    demos/demo_30/hubble.plot, demos/demo_31/SCSI.plot

Nature:		From now on, BCG_STEADY and BCG_TRANSIENT generate throughput
            files in which the columns of the second group are sorted by
            alphabetic order of their labels. This change makes the output
            of BCG_STEADY and BCG_TRANSIENT deterministic, as the user
            can now predict in which order the columns will appear. The
            manual pages and the Gnuplot scripts of demos 30 and 31 have
            been updated accordingly.
