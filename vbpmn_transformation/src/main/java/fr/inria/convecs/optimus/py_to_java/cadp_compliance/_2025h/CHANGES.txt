The following changes of CADP may have impacted the generated LNT code: #3185, #3187, #3190.
Each CADP change is referenced below, with the modifications performed (DONE, UNKNOWN, NOTHING TO DO).
By convention, CADP items are represented with ``----'', while sub-items (such as TRAIAN ones) are
represented with ``####''.

-------------------#3185: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3185
Date:		Tue Jul 29 15:09:35 CEST 2025
Authors:	Hubert Garavel and Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, lib/scheme_range.lnt,
		doc/pdf/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf

Nature:		The predefined function VAL() on range types was removed:
		from now on, it is no longer allowed to specify "with VAL"
		on a range type. Indeed, this function (inspired by the
		CHR() function of Pascal) was seldom used, as it could be
		easily obtained by other means:

		- For a type T defined as "type T is range M...N of Nat" or
		  "type T is range M...N of Int", the value VAL (X) was simply
		  equal to T (X + M).

		- For a type T defined as "type T is range M...N of Char",
		  the value VAL (X) was equal to T (Char (X + Nat (M))).

-------------------#3187: UNKNOWN-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3187
Date:		Thu Jul 31 16:58:53 CEST 2025
Authors:	Hubert Garavel and Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		lib/lnt_predefined.lnt, lib/LNT_V1.lib, incl/LNT_V1.h,
		doc/pdf/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf

Nature:		The predefined library of LNT has been enriched with 4 new
		functions that may raise exceptions:

		   + : [Exit] Nat, Nat -> Nat
		   - : [Exit] Int -> Int
		   + : [Exit] Int, Int -> Int
		   - : [Exit] Int, Int -> Int

		Both TRAIAN and LNT2LOTOS and their manuals have been updated.
		This change might not be backward compatible. For instance,
		the following process definition:

		   process MAIN [UNDERFLOW : Exit, PRINT : any] is
		      PRINT (1 -[UNDERFLOW] 2)
		   end process

		was formerly accepted, but is now rejected:

		   in behaviour: PRINT (1 -[UNDERFLOW] 2)
		   offer 1 -[UNDERFLOW] 2 may have several types NAT|INT,
		   one of which should be chosen using an "of" coercion

		Indeed, one must insert either "of Nat" or "of Int" after
		constants 1 and/or 2.

		Additionally, the already existing function
		   - : [Exit] Nat, Nat -> Nat
		is now implemented by LNT2LOTOS as an external C function
		(rather than being defined in LOTOS) for symmetry with the
		above functions.

-------------------#3190: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3190
Date:		Tue Aug  5 11:06:43 CEST 2025
Authors:	Hubert Garavel and Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		lib/lnt_predefined.lnt, lib/LNT_V1.lib, incl/LNT_V1.h,
		doc/pdf/Champelovier-Clerc-Garavel-et-al-10.pdf

Nature:		The predefined library of LNT has been simplified by removing
		two functions recently introduced (see item #3170 above):

		   Real : [Exit] Nat -> Real
		   Real : [Exit] Int -> Real

		These functions were useless. Indeed, given that Reals are
		implemented using the "double" type of C, no exception may
		occur when converting Nats or Ints to Reals.

		Additionally, in the LNT_V1 library of LNT2LOTOS, the
		implementation of the three functions ADT_TO_CHAR_NAT_EXIT(),
		ADT_TO_INT_NAT_EXIT(), and ADT_TO_NAT_INT_EXIT() has been
		enhanced, although the changes are not visible to end users.
