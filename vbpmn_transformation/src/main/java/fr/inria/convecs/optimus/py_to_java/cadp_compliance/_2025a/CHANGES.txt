Nature:		The TRAIAN compiler included in the CADP release has been
		upgraded from version 3.16 beta-7 to version 3.16. This new
		version brings the following changes:

		a) More static semantics checks have been added for the
		   (newly introduced) virtual processes.

		   The value parameters of virtual processes should not be
		   declared with modes "in var" or "out var", but "in" or
		   "out", respectively.

		   Each virtual process can be instantiated with another
		   "real" process having the same name and the same profile,
		   i.e., parameters with the same names, types or channels,
		   and modes; however, the "in" and "out" parameters of a
		   virtual processs may be matched by the corresponding
		   "in var" and "out var" parameters of a real process.

		   This real process may be defined in a module that is not
		   transitively imported or included by M. Such a situation
		   does not trigger any warning from TRAIAN.

		b) The static detection by TRAIAN of Boolean conditions that
		   are always true or always false has been enhanced. This
		   leads to more warnings about tautologies and dead code.
		   Also, certain LNT programs that were formerly accepted
		   are now rejected, e.g.:

		      function F (in var X : Int) : Int is
		         while not (false [...] ()) loop
		            X := X - 1
		         end loop;
		         return X
		      end function

		c) The following issue was fixed: when TRAIAN was invoked
		   to process an LNT file not contained in the current
		   directory, e.g.:

		      traian DIR/FILE.lnt

		   it would search the libraries included by FILE.lnt (using
		   the "library clause") in the current directory rather
		   than in directory DIR.
