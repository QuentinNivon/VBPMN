Nature:		The LNT language was simplified by merging the two symbols
		".." (used in the definition of range and array types) and
		"..." (used in lists and sets). From now on, the ".." symbol
		(inherited from Pascal and Ada) is replaced by "...".

		The LNT2LOTOS Reference Manual and the CADP demos have been
		updated accordingly.

		The ".." is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the
		future. At the moment, both LNT2LOTOS and TRAIAN still accept
		it, but TRAIAN emits the following warning:
		   ".." is deprecated and should be replaced by "..."

		Users are thus advised to update their LNT programs. This can
		be done automatically by typing the following command:
		   upc 2025-LNT-DOT-DOT <directory>
		which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
		<directory>, look for ".lnt" files, and automatically replace
		".." with "...".
