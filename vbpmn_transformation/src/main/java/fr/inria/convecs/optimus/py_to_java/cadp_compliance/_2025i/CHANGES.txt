IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3201
Date:		Thu Sep  4 10:11:24 CEST 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos, com/upc

Nature:		At present, the handwritten ".fnt"/".tnt" files used by
		LNT2LOTOS are not compatible with those used by TRAIAN.
		To increase the compatibility, the following changes have
		been brought:

		- From now on, when a LNT type T has no !comparedby pragma,
		  the C identifier automatically generated by TRAIAN for the
		  comparison function T, T -> Bool is named "TRAIAN_EQUAL_<T>"
		  instead of ""TRAIAN_CMP_<T>".

		- From now on, when a LNT type T has no !comparedby pragma,
		  the C identifier automatically generated by LNT2LOTOS for
		  the comparison function T, T -> Bool is also named
		  "TRAIAN_EQUAL_<T>" instead of "CAESAR_ADT_CMP_<T>".

		- When a LNT type T has no !printedby pragma, the C identifier
		  automatically generated by LNT2LOTOS for the printing
		  function FILE *, T -> void is now named "TRAIAN_PRINT_<T>"
		  instead of "CAESAR_ADT_PRT_<T>".

		- When a LNT type T has no !iteratedby pragma, the two C
		  identifiers automatically generated by LNT2LOTOS for the
		  iterator over T are now named "TRAIAN_ITERATE_FIRST_<T>"
		  and "TRAIAN_ITERATE_NEXT<T>", respectively, instead of
		  "CAESAR_ADT_ITR_FIRST_<T>" and "CAESAR_ADT_ITR_NEXT_<T>".

		Consequently, for any external type T, LNT2LOTOS now generates
		LOTOS code that associates to T the following pragmas:

		   T (*! implementedby T comparedby TRAIAN_CMP_T iteratedby
		         TRAIAN_ITERATE_FIRST_T and TRAIAN_ITERATE_NEXT_T
			 printedby TRAIAN_PRINT_T external *)

		whereas it would formerly generate only:

		   T (*! external *)

		As a consequence, more LNT programs accepted by TRAIAN now
		compile properly with LNT2LOTOS, whereas, formerly, the
		C code generated by LNT2LOTOS and CAESAR.ADT was rejected
		by the C compiler.

		Users are advised to update their ".fnt" and ".tnt" files.
		This can be done automatically by typing the following command:
		   upc 2025-LNT-C-NAMES <directory>
		which will recursively explore the contents of the specified
		<directory> and perform appropriate substitutions in ".fnt"
		and ".tnt" files automatically.
