-------------------#3095: NOTHING TO DO ????-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3095
Date:		Wed Jan 22 17:14:32 CET 2025

Author:		Frederic Lang (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/lnt2lotos

Nature:		Since June 30, 2024, TRAIAN no longer accepts that an
		expression F [E] can be interpreted as a call to a function F
		that has no argument and returns a result of type array, from
		which the element having index E is selected. For such an
		interpretation, the expression should now be written either
		(F) [E] or F () [E].

		LNT2LOTOS was recently modified to get aligned with TRAIAN in
		this respect. As a consequence, LNT2LOTOS no longer generates
		incorrect LOTOS code (later rejected by CAESAR and CAESAR.ADT)
		for LNT programs such as:

		   function F [E : exit] : bool is
		      raise E
		   end function

		   process MAIN [G: any, E : exit] is
		      G (F [E])
		   end process

		This change may also modify the semantics of some LNT program:

		   type T is array [0 .. 1] of nat end type

		   function F : T is
		      return T (0)
		   end function

		   function F [E : exit] : nat is
		      access E;
		      return 1
		   end function

		   process MAIN [PRINT : any, E : exit] is
		      var E, X : nat in
		         E := 0;
		         X := F [E]
		         -- note: there is no variable F of array type here
		         -- at this point: formerly, X == 0 but now, X == 1
		      end var
		   end process

-------------------#3096: NOTHING TO DO-------------------

IMPROVEMENT
Number:		3096
Date:		Tue Jan 28 15:32:40 CET 2025
Authors:	Frederic Lang and Hubert Garavel (INRIA/CONVECS)
Files:		bin.*/traian, com/lnt.open, man/*/traian.*

Nature:		Formerly, when an LNT program had a single (non-virtual)
		process, TRAIAN considered it as the entry point, even if
		this process was not called "MAIN". It is no longer the case:
		to have a simpler semantics, this process must be called
		"MAIN", otherwise TRAIAN (unless given the "-analysis" option)
		emits the following error message:

		   no main process found (define one or use "-main" option)

		Consequently, TRAIAN has been equipped with a "-main" option
		that is similar to the "-root" option of LNT2LOTOS. Syntactic
		and semantic checks have been added, which verify that the
		argument of this option is correct (binding, type checking,
		parameter checking, etc.).

		The manual page of TRAIAN and the LNT.OPEN shell script have
		been updated accordingly. It is now clearly stated that the
		options "-analysis", "-c", and "-lotos" of TRAIAN are mutally
		exclusive.

Nature:		The XTL_EXPAND preprocessor, which is used by XTL and the
		EVALUATOR model checkers, was enhanced to support single-line
		comments beginning with "--", in addition to the existing
		multi-line comments delimited by "(*" and "*)". Thus, one
		may now use single-line comments in XTL programs and MCL
		formulas.

		The manual pages and the editor style files for the MCL and
		XTL languages have been updated accordingly. The SVL files
		of various CADP demos have also been simplified by replacing,
		where appropriate, multi-line comments "(*" ... "*)" by
		single-line comments "--"  in the MCL and XTL code fragments.

		Finally, three include files for the XTL compiler have been
		updated to introduce C24-compliant function prototypes.
