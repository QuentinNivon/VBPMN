##### How to compare two PIF files #####

There are two scripts: compare.py and checkprop.py.


$ python compare.py file1.pif file2.pif operation [options]

This command converts each PIF file into an LTS (internal behavior
removed), and compares them wrt. the given operation (strong
equivalence/preorder). Options can be used for hiding/renaming
purposes.

There are 3 available operations so far:

   ">" -> the first LTS simulates the second LTS

   "<" -> the second LTS simulates the first LTS

   "=" -> both LTSs are equivalent

There are three (exclusive) options:

   "e" op "file.hide" -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
                     are compared up-to-alphabet hiding all alphabet elements but for those in file.hide

   "h" op "file.hide" -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared up-to-alphabet hiding alphabet elements in file.hide

   "r" op "file.ren"  -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared after renaming

   "c" op "file.pif"  -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared after (synchronous) composition
       	  	      	 with file.bcg


$ python checkprop.py file1.pif file2.pif file.mcl

This command converts each PIF file into an LTS (internal behavior
removed), and checks that both process LTSs respect the property
specified in file.mcl.
