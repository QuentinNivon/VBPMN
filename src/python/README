##### How to compare two CIF files? #####

$ python pif2lnt file1.cif file2.cif operation

-> This command converts each file into an LTS (internal behavior
   removed), and compares them wrt. the given operation (strong
   equivalence/preorder)

-> Operations supported so far:

   ">" the first LTS simulates the second LTS

   "<" the second LTS simulates the first LTS

   "=" both LTSs are equivalent
