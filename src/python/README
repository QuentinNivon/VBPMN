##### How to compare two PIF files #####

$ python vbpmn.py file1.pif file2.pif operation [files]

This command converts each file into an LTS (internal behavior
removed), and compares them wrt. the given operation (strong
equivalence/preorder)

Operations supported so far:

   ">" -> the first LTS simulates the second LTS

   "<" -> the second LTS simulates the first LTS

   "=" -> both LTSs are equivalent

   "p" "file.mcl" -> both process LTSs respect the property specified in file.mcl

   "h" op "file.hide" -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared up-to-alphabet

   "r" op "file.ren"  -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared after renaming

   "c" op "file.bcg"  -> where op is ">" or "<" or "=", both processes
       	  	      	 are compared after (synchronous) composition
       	  	      	 with file.bcg
